no GCM tags:

Chunks are
0-100
100-200
200-300

Want range [50, 150]

For each chunk,
	intersect chunk range & want range
	if has intersection, get that range
	if no intersection, filter out

intersect([0, 100], [50, 150]) == [50, 100]
intersect([100, 200], [50, 150]) == [100, 150]
intersect([200, 300], [50, 150]) == null

Set up AES decipher, position up to 16-1 bytes before the bytes we need
Feed up to 16-1 NULL bytes into AES decipher
Feed each chunk into AES decipher

with GCM tags:

0-100000
100000-200000
200000-300000

Want range [50000, 150000]
Adjust range to include GCM tags
Idea: map byte ranges to GCM blocks, then map blocks to physical byte ranges
