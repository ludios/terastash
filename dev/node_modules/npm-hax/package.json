  "readme": "npm-hax\n===\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]\n\n`npm-hax` is a replacement for the npm binary that lets you blacklist\ndependencies at any depth in your dependency tree.  I was motivated to write\nthis after finding four different versions of [request](https://github.com/request/request)\nin my dependency tree, which was noticeably slowing down my program's startup.\n\nDon't use this unless you know what you're doing.  It's probably better to\nsubmit pull requests bumping minor versions or changing them to lock to major versions.\n\n\n\nInstall\n---\n\nIn your project, run:\n\n```\nnpm install -g npm-hax\n```\n\nor install from the GitHub repo:\n\n```\nnpm install -g ludios/npm-hax\n```\n\n\n\nUsage\n---\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```\nDEPS_BLACKLIST=\"module/dep ...\" npm-hax any-npm-command\n```\n\nwhich will prevent npm from seeing `\"dep\": \"version\"` in both `dependencies`\nand `devDependencies` in any `package.json` with `\"name\": \"module\"`.\n\n\n\nExample\n---\n\n```sh\nrm -rf node_modules\nDEPS_BLACKLIST=\"googleapis/request google-auth-library/request \\\ngtoken/request gapitoken/request\" npm-hax install\nfind node_modules/ | grep request\n# victory dance\n```\n\nRemember to run `npm-hax` and not `npm`!!\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm-hax.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/npm-hax\n\n\n\nPrebuild removal feature\n---\n\nSome packages like leveldown use `prebuild`, which has a massive dependency\ntree but is not actually needed if you're building the package yourself.  Simply\nremoving prebuild using `DEPS_BLACKLIST` is an incomplete solution: npm\nstill tries to run `prebuild` scripts mentioned in `package.json`, thus breaking\n`npm install`.  So npm-hax also supports removing all 'scripts' in package.json\nthat start with `\"prebuild \"` with `REMOVE_PREBUILD=1`.  If you are versioning\nnode_modules/, this lets you avoid keeping prebuild's dependency tree around.\n",
